## Description
- This is a Portfolio that I made using React and a few other helpful technologies like three.js, email.js, and framer motion. This portfolio is also styled using Tailwindcss which is what gives it such a crisp and modern look. The 3D models being displayed in the site utilize three.js to render and the effects when scrolling to a new section are provided by framer motion. The app also uses email.js for the email contact form functionality. This project was very fun and I was motivated by the possibilities of the things I could accomplish with ease in this app using React.
